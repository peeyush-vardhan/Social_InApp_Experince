# Social_InApp_Experince
Build a new social feature for Wynk that integrates seamlessly into the app’s existing UI in iOS and Android. The social feature should serve to connect people through music, and not interfere with current user flows and paths (music discovery and recommendation) in Wynk
 
 **Why social in-app experience?**
● Brands are limited to the ways they can engage digitally with their customers and create social communities.
● Consumers want brands to connect with them, so this limitation in methods of engagement is causing brands to look
to their own apps to build connections with customers.
● In-app experience can help to reel in new customers, but also retain app users and turn them into brand advocates.
